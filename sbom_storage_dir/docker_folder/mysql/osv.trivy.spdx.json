Users should update to this version as soon as possible.\n\nThis fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities.\n\nIn addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.\n\n### Credits\nThe opencontainers project would like to thank [Andrew G. Morgan](https://github.com/AndrewGMorgan) for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [opencontainers org security policy](https://github.com/opencontainers/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/new)\n* Email us at [security@opencontainers.org](mailto:security@opencontainers.org) if you think you’ve found a security bug",
