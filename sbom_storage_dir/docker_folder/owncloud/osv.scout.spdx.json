              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. When using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_USERPWD` options before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Previously, we would only consider a change in host. Now, we consider any change in host, port or scheme to be a change in origin.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle stream handler backend, rather than curl.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n* [CVE-2022-27776](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\nPrevious version of Guzzle contain a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the `Set-Cookie` header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. For example an attacker at `www.example.com` might set a session cookie for `api.example.net`, logging the Guzzle client into their account and retrieving private API requests from the security log of their account.\n\nNote that our cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with `['cookies' =\u003e true]` are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.3 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.6 or 7.4.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you do not need support for cookies, turn off the cookie middleware. It is already off by default, but if you have turned it on and no longer need it, turn it off.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC6265 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.3)\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` and `Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different port, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers from the request, before containing. Previously, we would only consider a change in host or scheme downgrade. Now, we consider any change in host, port or scheme to be a change in origin.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n* [CVE-2022-27776](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/). Do not report additional security advisories in that public channel, however - please follow our [vulnerability reporting process](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/security/policy).\n",

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. When using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_USERPWD` options before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Previously, we would only consider a change in host. Now, we consider any change in host, port or scheme to be a change in origin.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle stream handler backend, rather than curl.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n* [CVE-2022-27776](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "summary": "Cross-domain cookie leakage in Guzzle",
              "details": "### Impact\n\nPrevious version of Guzzle contain a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the `Set-Cookie` header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. For example an attacker at `www.example.com` might set a session cookie for `api.example.net`, logging the Guzzle client into their account and retrieving private API requests from the security log of their account.\n\nNote that our cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with `['cookies' =\u003e true]` are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.3 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.6 or 7.4.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you do not need support for cookies, turn off the cookie middleware. It is already off by default, but if you have turned it on and no longer need it, turn it off.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC6265 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.3)\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` and `Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different port, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers from the request, before containing. Previously, we would only consider a change in host or scheme downgrade. Now, we consider any change in host, port or scheme to be a change in origin.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n* [CVE-2022-27776](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/). Do not report additional security advisories in that public channel, however - please follow our [vulnerability reporting process](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/security/policy).\n",

Under certain specific conditions this could potentially allow a malicious user to execute code remotely.\n\nThe conditions: \n\n- A user is allowed to supply the path or filename of an uploaded file.\n- The supplied path or filename is not checked against unicode chars.\n- The supplied pathname checked against an extension deny-list, not an allow-list.\n- The supplied path or filename contains a unicode whitespace char in the extension.\n- The uploaded file is stored in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed.\n\nGiven these conditions are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system under attack.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe unicode whitespace removal has been replaced with a rejection (exception).\n\nThe library has been patched in:\n- 1.x: https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/commit/f3ad69181b8afed2c9edf7be5a2918144ff4ea32\n- 2.x: https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/commit/a3c694de9f7e844b76f9d1b61296ebf6e8d89d74\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users, upgrade to 2.1.1.\n",

              "details": "PEAR Archive_Tar version 1.4.3 and earlier contains a CWE-502, CWE-915 vulnerability in the Archive_Tar class. There are several file operations with `$v_header['filename']` as parameter (such as file_exists, is_file, is_dir, etc). When extract is called without a specific prefix path, we can trigger unserialization by crafting a tar file with `phar://[path_to_malicious_phar_file]` as path. Object injection can be used to trigger destruct in the loaded PHP classes, e.g. the Archive_Tar class itself. With Archive_Tar object injection, arbitrary file deletion can occur because `@unlink($this-\u003e_temp_tarname)` is called. If another class with useful gadget is loaded, it may possible to cause remote code execution that can result in files being deleted or possibly modified. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.4.4.",

By sending malformed requests, the\n http/2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server\n thread cleaning up incoming data, resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-17199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17199)\nDiego Angulo from ImExHS discovered that mod\\_session\\_cookie does not\n respect expiry time.\n* [CVE-2019-0196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0196)\nCraig Young discovered that the http/2 request handling in mod\\_http2\n could be made to access freed memory in string comparison when\n determining the method of a request and thus process the request\n incorrectly.\n* [CVE-2019-0211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0211)\nCharles Fol discovered a privilege escalation from the\n less-privileged child process to the parent process running as root.\n* [CVE-2019-0217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0217)\nA race condition in mod\\_auth\\_digest when running in a threaded\n server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate\n using another username, bypassing configured access control\n restrictions. The issue was discovered by Simon Kappel.\n* [CVE-2019-0220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0220)\nBernhard Lorenz of Alpha Strike Labs GmbH reported that URL\n normalizations were inconsistently handled. When the path component\n of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'),\n directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for\n duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers\n processing will implicitly collapse them.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.25-3+deb9u7.\n\n\nThis update also contains bug fixes that were scheduled for inclusion in the\nnext stable point release. This includes a fix for a regression caused by a\nsecurity fix in version 2.4.25-3+deb9u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache2 please refer to its security\ntracker page at: \u003chttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2\u003e\n\n\n",

This vulnerability could be used by\nan attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject\nmalicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized\nas a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root\nprivileges on the target machine.\n\n\nSince the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is\nrecommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this\nupgrade only, using:\n\n\n`apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update  \n\napt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade`\nThis is known to break some proxies when used against security.debian.org. If\nthat happens, people can switch their security APT source to use:\n\n\n`deb \u003chttp://cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org/debian-security\u003e stable/updates main`\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.\n\n\nSpecific upgrade instructions:\n\n\nIf upgrading using APT without redirect is not possible in your situation, you\ncan manually download the files (using wget/curl) for your architecture using\nthe URL provided below, verifying that the hashes match.

              "details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in curl, a command line tool for\ntransferring data with URL syntax and an easy-to-use client-side URL\ntransfer library.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-8284](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8284)\nWhen curl performs a passive FTP transfer, it first tries the EPSV\n command and if that is not supported, it falls back to using PASV.\n Passive mode is what curl uses by default. A server response to a\n PASV command includes the (IPv4) address and port number for the\n client to connect back to in order to perform the actual data\n transfer. This is how the FTP protocol is designed to work. A\n malicious server can use the PASV response to trick curl into\n connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way\n potentially make curl extract information about services that are\n otherwise private and not disclosed, for example doing port scanning\n and service banner extractions.\n\n\nThe IP address part of the response is now ignored by default, by\n making CURLOPT\\_FTP\\_SKIP\\_PASV\\_IP default to 1L instead of previously\n being 0L. This has the minor drawback that a small fraction of use\n cases might break, when a server truly needs the client to connect\n back to a different IP address than what the control connection uses\n and for those CURLOPT\\_FTP\\_SKIP\\_PASV\\_IP can be set to 0L. The same\n goes for the command line tool, which then might need\n --no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip set to prevent curl from ignoring the address\n in the server response.\n* [CVE-2020-8285](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8285)\nlibcurl offers a wildcard matching functionality, which allows a\n callback (set with CURLOPT\\_CHUNK\\_BGN\\_FUNCTION) to return information\n back to libcurl on how to handle a specific entry in a directory\n when libcurl iterates over a list of all available entries. When\n this callback returns CURL\\_CHUNK\\_BGN\\_FUNC\\_SKIP, to tell libcurl to\n not deal with that file, the internal function in libcurl then calls\n itself recursively to handle the next directory entry. If there's a\n sufficient amount of file entries and if the callback returns skip\n enough number of times, libcurl runs out of stack space. The exact\n amount will of course vary with platforms, compilers and other\n environmental factors. The content of the remote directory is not\n kept on the stack, so it seems hard for the attacker to control\n exactly what data that overwrites the stack - however it remains a\n Denial-Of-Service vector as a malicious user who controls a server\n that a libcurl-using application works with under these premises can\n trigger a crash.\n\n\nThe internal function is rewritten to instead and more appropriately\n use an ordinary loop instead of the recursive approach. This way,\n the stack use will remain the same no matter how many files that are\n skipped.\n* [CVE-2020-8286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8286)\nlibcurl offers OCSP stapling via the CURLOPT\\_SSL\\_VERIFYSTATUS\n option. When set, libcurl verifies the OCSP response that a server\n responds with as part of the TLS handshake. It then aborts the TLS\n negotiation if something is wrong with the response. The same\n feature can be enabled with --cert-status using the curl tool. As\n part of the OCSP response verification, a client should verify that\n the response is indeed set out for the correct certificate. This\n step was not performed by libcurl when built or told to use OpenSSL\n as TLS backend. This flaw would allow an attacker, who perhaps\n could have breached a TLS server, to provide a fraudulent OCSP\n response that would appear fine, instead of the real one. Like if\n the original certificate actually has been revoked.\n\n\nThe OCSP response checker function now also verifies that the\n certificate id is the correct one.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.52.1-5+deb9u13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of curl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n\u003chttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl\u003e\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: \u003chttps://wiki.debian.org/LTS\u003e\n\n\n",

A user permitted to mount and access\n arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service\n (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-27815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27815)\nA flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local\n attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a\n denial of service.\n* [CVE-2020-27825](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27825)\nAdam pi3 Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace\n ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could\n result in denial of service or information leak.\n* [CVE-2020-28374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-28374)\nDavid Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation\n performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An\n attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number\n assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any\n LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.\n* [CVE-2020-29568](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29568) ([XSA-349](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-349.html))\n\n Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can\n trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.\n* [CVE-2020-29569](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29569) ([XSA-350](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-350.html))\n\n Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free\n flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback.

In some circumstances, an attacker within\n range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary\n packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.\n* [CVE-2020-24588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-24588)\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,\n including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the is\n aggregated packet header flag. An attacker within range of a\n network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that\n network.\n* [CVE-2020-25670](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25670), [CVE-2020-25671](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25671), [CVE-2021-23134](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23134)\nkiyin (ĺ°šäşŽ) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs\n in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.\n A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\n\nNadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that\n the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could\n result in use-after-free and double-free. This has also been\n fixed.\n* [CVE-2020-25672](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25672)\nkiyin (ĺ°šäşŽ) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP\n implementation. A local user could exploit this for denial of\n service (memory exhaustion).\n* [CVE-2020-26139](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26139)\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,\n including Linux's mac80211. When operating in AP mode, they would\n forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender\n was not yet authenticated. An attacker within range of a network\n could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting\n other vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2020-26558](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-26558), [CVE-2021-0129](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-0129)\nResearchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth\n Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of\n it. An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they\n pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the\n shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices\n to each other.\n* [CVE-2020-29374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29374)\nJann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory\n management. A parent and child process initially share all their\n memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is\n duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write). However, in case an\n operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an\n additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs\n during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong\n process's memory. For some programs, this could lead to an\n information leak or data corruption.\n* [CVE-2020-36322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36322), [CVE-2021-28950](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28950)\nThe syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)\n implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning\n invalid attributes for a file. A local user permitted to run a\n FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n\n\nThe original fix for this introduced a different potential denial\n of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been\n fixed.\n* [CVE-2021-3428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3428)\nWolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4\n filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem\n images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2021-3483](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3483)\néŠŹĺ˛ĺŽ (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the nosy driver for TI\n PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption\n and a use-after-free. On a system that uses this driver, local\n users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-3564](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3564), [CVE-2021-3573](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3573), [CVE-2021-32399](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-32399)\nThe BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the\n Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or\n double-free. A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of\n service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-3587](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3587)\nActive Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null\n pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation. A local user\n could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2021-20292](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20292)\nIt was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU\n drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most\n drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure. A local\n user on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit\n this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or\n for privilege escalation. The API has been changed to match\n driver expectations.\n* [CVE-2021-23133](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23133)\nOr Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the\n SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption. A local\n user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-28660](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28660)\nIt was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly\n limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker\n within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service\n (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a\n vulnerable system.\n* [CVE-2021-28688](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28688) ([XSA-371](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-371.html))\n\n It was discovered that the original fix for [CVE-2021-26930](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-26930)\n ([XSA-365](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-365.html)) introduced a potential resource leak. A malicious guest\n could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service\n (resource exhaustion) within the host.\n* [CVE-2021-28964](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28964)\nZygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which\n can lead to an assertion failure. On systems using Btrfs, a local\n user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2021-28971](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-28971)\nVince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for\n Intel PEBS. A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs\n codenamed Haswell and earlier could lead to a null pointer\n dereference. On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are\n permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit\n this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n\n\nBy default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance\n events, which mitigates this issue. This is controlled by the\n kernel.perf\\_event\\_paranoid sysctl.\n* [CVE-2021-29154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-29154)\nIt was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler\n for x86\\_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some\n cases. On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could\n exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.\n\n\nBy default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue. This is\n controlled by the net.core.bpf\\_jit\\_enable sysctl.\n* [CVE-2021-29265](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-29265)\nThe syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host\n (server) implementation which can lead to a null pointer\n dereference. On a system acting as a USB/IP host, a client\n can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2021-29647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-29647)\nThe syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC\n Router (qrtr) implementation.\n\n\nThis protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel\n configurations.\n* [CVE-2021-29650](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-29650)\nIt was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem\n could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a\n table. A local user with CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability in any user\n namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n\n\nBy default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,\n which mitigates this issue. This is controlled by the\n kernel.unprivileged\\_userns\\_clone sysctl.\n* [CVE-2021-30002](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-30002)\nArnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the\n Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. A local user permitted to access\n video devices (by default, any member of the video group) could\n exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n* [CVE-2021-31916](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-31916)\nDan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the\n device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer\n overrun. However, only users with CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN capability\n (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not\n have any security impact in this kernel version.\n* [CVE-2021-33034](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33034)\nThe syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could\n lead to a use-after-free. A local user could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n4.9.272-1.

A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its\n underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-20322](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20322)\nAn information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation. A\n remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP\n ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a\n DNS poisoning attack against that system.\n* [CVE-2021-22543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22543)\nDavid Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps\n host memory into a guest. A local user permitted to access\n /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when\n they should not, leading to a use-after-free. This could be used\n to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or\n possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2021-37159](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-37159)\nA flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile\n broadband modems. An error during initialisation could lead to a\n double-free or use-after-free. An attacker able to plug in USB\n devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.\n* [CVE-2021-38160](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38160)\nA flaw in the virtio\\_console was discovered allowing data\n corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.\n* [CVE-2021-38198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38198)\nA flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86\n processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within\n a guest not being applied correctly. When shadow page tables are\n used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT\n or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit\n this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the\n guest.\n* [CVE-2021-38199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38199)\nMichael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client\n implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows\n operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2021-38204](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38204)\nA flaw was discovered in the max4321-hcd USB host controller\n driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.\n\n\nHowever, this driver is not included in the binary packages\n provided by Debian.\n* [CVE-2021-38205](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-38205)\nAn information leak was discovered in the xilinx\\_emaclite network\n driver.

For at\nleast AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to\na leak of sensitive information.\n\n\nThis update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates\n4.9.304-4.9.320 inclusive. The random driver has been backported from\nLinux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and correctness issues. Some\nchanges will be visible:\n\n\n- The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096. You may need\n to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space\n entropy gathering services to allow for this.\n\n\n- On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more\n uses of /dev/urandom before it is fully initialised. These uses\n were previously under-counted and this is not a regression.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n\u003chttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux\u003e\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: \u003chttps://wiki.debian.org/LTS\u003e\n\n\n",

We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know\n that your network requires a lower value.\n* [CVE-2019-11486](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11486)\nJann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the\n Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to\n cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been\n disabled.\n* [CVE-2019-11599](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11599)\nJann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump\n implementation which could lead to a use-after-free. A local\n user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a\n denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-11815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11815)\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram\n Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially\n privilege escalation. This protocol module (rds) is not auto loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where\n it is explicitly loaded.\n* [CVE-2019-11833](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11833)\nIt was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes\n uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. A\n local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the\n filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be\n able to use this to obtain sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2019-11884](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11884)\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not\n ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. A local\n user with CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to\n obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.9.168-1+deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n\u003chttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux\u003e\n\n\n",

              "details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2015-8553](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8553)\nJan Beulich discovered that [CVE-2015-2150](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2150) was not completely\n addressed. If a PCI physical function is passed through to a\n Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O\n regions before enabling decoding of those regions. This could\n result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host.\n\n\nThe fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5.\n* [CVE-2017-18509](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18509)\nDenis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast\n routing implementation. A user with the CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability (in\n any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory\n corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2018-5995](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5995)\nADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual\n addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to\n exploit other vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2018-20836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20836)\nchenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel\n subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which\n could lead to a use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be\n exploited.\n* [CVE-2018-20856](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20856)\nXiao Jin reported a potential double-free in the block subsystem,\n in case an error occurs while initialising the I/O scheduler for a\n block device. It is not clear how this might be exploited.\n* [CVE-2019-1125](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1125)\nIt was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively\n skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the\n kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when\n it should be skipped. This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,\n which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from\n the kernel or other processes. It has been mitigated by using\n memory barriers to limit speculative execution. Systems using an\n i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.\n* [CVE-2019-3882](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3882)\nIt was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number\n of DMA mappings to device memory. A local user granted ownership\n of a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service\n (out-of-memory condition).\n* [CVE-2019-3900](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3900)\nIt was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the\n amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A\n malicious guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service\n (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.\n* [CVE-2019-10207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10207)\nThe syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various\n drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with\n access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this\n for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).\n* [CVE-2019-10638](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10638)\nAmit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP\n packet IDs used a weak hash function, jhash. This could enable\n tracking individual computers as they communicate with different\n remote servers and from different networks. The siphash\n function is now used instead.\n* [CVE-2019-10639](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-10639)\nAmit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP\n packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel\n virtual address. This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs,\n although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack.\n* [CVE-2019-13631](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13631)\nIt was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could\n overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's\n descriptor. A physically present user with a specially\n constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service\n (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-13648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-13648)\nPraveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without\n Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to\n restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call. A local\n user could use this for denial-of-service (oops).\n* [CVE-2019-14283](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14283)\nThe syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk\n driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a\n disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the\n I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.\n* [CVE-2019-14284](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-14284)\nThe syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the\n floppy disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk\n device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).\n* [CVE-2019-15239](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-15239)\nDenis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the\n TCP sockets implementation. A local user could use this for\n denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n* (CVE ID not yet assigned)\n\n The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as\n user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other\n security vulnerabilities.\n* XSA-300\n\n Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory\n which a domain will attempt to balloon out, nor limits the amount of\n \"foreign / grant map\" memory which any individual guest can consume,\n leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems were mostly fixed\nin version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2 or earlier.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n\u003chttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux\u003e\n\n\n",

              "details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information\nleak.\n\n\n* [CVE-2018-12207](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12207)\nIt was discovered that on Intel CPUs supporting hardware\n virtualisation with Extended Page Tables (EPT), a guest VM may\n manipulate the memory management hardware to cause a Machine Check\n Error (MCE) and denial of service (hang or crash).\n\n\nThe guest triggers this error by changing page tables without a\n TLB flush, so that both 4 KB and 2 MB entries for the same virtual\n address are loaded into the instruction TLB (iTLB). This update\n implements a mitigation in KVM that prevents guest VMs from\n loading 2 MB entries into the iTLB. This will reduce performance\n of guest VMs.\n\n\nFurther information on the mitigation can be found at\n \n or in the linux-doc-4.9 or linux-doc-4.19 package.\n\n\nA qemu update adding support for the PSCHANGE\\_MC\\_NO feature, which\n allows to disable iTLB Multihit mitigations in nested hypervisors\n will be provided via DSA 4566-1.\n\n\nIntel's explanation of the issue can be found at\n .\n* [CVE-2019-0154](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0154)\nIntel discovered that on their 8th and 9th generation GPUs,\n reading certain registers while the GPU is in a low-power state\n can cause a system hang. A local user permitted to use the GPU\n can use this for denial of service.\n\n\nThis update mitigates the issue through changes to the i915\n driver.\n\n\nThe affected chips (gen8 and gen9) are listed at\n .\n* [CVE-2019-0155](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0155)\nIntel discovered that their 9th generation and newer GPUs are\n missing a security check in the Blitter Command Streamer (BCS). A\n local user permitted to use the GPU could use this to access any\n memory that the GPU has access to, which could result in a denial\n of service (memory corruption or crash), a leak of sensitive\n information, or privilege escalation.\n\n\nThis update mitigates the issue by adding the security check to\n the i915 driver.\n\n\nThe affected chips (gen9 onward) are listed at\n .\n* [CVE-2019-11135](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11135)\nIt was discovered that on Intel CPUs supporting transactional\n memory (TSX), a transaction that is going to be aborted may\n continue to execute speculatively, reading sensitive data from\n internal buffers and leaking it through dependent operations.\n Intel calls this TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA).\n\n\nFor CPUs affected by the previously published Microarchitectural\n Data Sampling (MDS) issues\n ([CVE-2018-12126](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12126),\n [CVE-2018-12127](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12127),\n [CVE-2018-12130](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12130),\n [CVE-2019-11091](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11091)),\n the existing mitigation also mitigates this issue.\n\n\nFor processors that are vulnerable to TAA but not MDS, this update\n disables TSX by default. This mitigation requires updated CPU\n microcode. An updated intel-microcode package (only available in\n Debian non-free) will be provided via DSA 4565-1. The updated CPU\n microcode may also be available as part of a system firmware\n (\"BIOS\") update.\n\n\nFurther information on the mitigation can be found at\n \n or in the linux-doc-4.9 or linux-doc-4.19 package.\n\n\nIntel's explanation of the issue can be found at\n .\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed\nin version 4.9.189-3+deb9u2.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 4.19.67-2+deb10u2.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux)\n\n\n",

              "details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\n\n\n* [CVE-2019-2182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-2182)\nHanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the arm64\n virtual memory management code, which could lead to an information\n disclosure, denial of service (crash), or possibly privilege\n escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-5108](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5108)\nMitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11\n (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger\n roaming for a newly associated station before the station was\n authenticated. An attacker within range of the AP could use this\n to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching\n table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.\n* [CVE-2019-19319](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19319)\nJungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4\n implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user\n permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of\n service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-19462](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19462)\nThe syzbot tool found a missing error check in the relay\n library used to implement various files under debugfs. A local\n user permitted to access debugfs could use this to cause a denial\n of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-19768](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19768)\nTristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug\n facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able\n to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to\n cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2019-20806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20806)\nA potential null pointer dereference was discovered in the tw5864\n media driver. The security impact of this is unclear.\n* [CVE-2019-20811](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20811)\nThe Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an error\n path in the network subsystem. The security impact of this is\n unclear.\n* [CVE-2020-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0543)\nResearchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs\n supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random\n value generated by these instructions may be used in a later\n speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.\n Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a\n local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive\n information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.\n\n\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either\n as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode\n package in Debian's non-free archive section. This kernel update\n only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to\n disable the mitigation if it is not needed.\n* [CVE-2020-2732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-2732)\nPaulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel\n processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2\n guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an\n L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or\n information leaks in the L1 guest.\n* [CVE-2020-8428](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8428)\nAl Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the filesystem\n core (vfs). A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of\n service (crash) or possibly to obtain sensitive information from\n the kernel.\n* [CVE-2020-8647](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8647),\n[CVE-2020-8649](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8649)\nThe Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in\n the vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual\n terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver\n could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-8648](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8648)\nThe syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal\n driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user\n permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-9383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-9383)\nJordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver\n which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user\n permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for\n privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-10711](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10711)\nMatthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues in the\n SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet with null category. A\n remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of\n service (crash). Note that this issue does not affect the binary\n packages distributed in Debian as CONFIG\\_NETLABEL is not enabled.\n* [CVE-2020-10732](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10732)\nAn information leak of kernel private memory to userspace was found\n in the kernel's implementation of core dumping userspace processes.\n* [CVE-2020-10751](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10751)\nDmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly\n handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged\n attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.\n* [CVE-2020-10757](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10757)\nFan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX hugepages,\n allowing a local user to escalate their privileges\n* [CVE-2020-10942](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10942)\nIt was discovered that the vhost\\_net driver did not properly\n validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user\n permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack\n corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of\n service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-11494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11494)\nIt was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver\n did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,\n resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or\n over the CAN network.\n* [CVE-2020-11565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11565)\nEntropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did\n not correctly handle an mpol mount option specifying an empty\n node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user\n namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-11608](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11608),\n[CVE-2020-11609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11609),\n[CVE-2020-11668](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-11668)\nIt was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink\\_cit media\n drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A\n physically present user with a specially constructed USB device\n could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly\n for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-12114](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12114)\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and\n pivot\\_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user\n with the CAP\\_SYS\\_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use\n this to cause a denial of service (crash).\n* [CVE-2020-12464](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12464)\nKyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can\n result in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be\n exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-12652](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12652)\nTom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.\n An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,\n creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking\n of internal data structures. A local user permitted to access\n /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or\n memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-12653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12653)\nIt was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not\n sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap\n buffer overflow. A local user with CAP\\_NET\\_ADMIN capability could\n use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)\n or possibly for privilege escalation.\n* [CVE-2020-12654](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12654)\nIt was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not\n sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point\n (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP\n could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory\n corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.\n* [CVE-2020-12770](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12770)\nIt was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not\n correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.\n A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use\n this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).\n* [CVE-2020-13143](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13143)\nKyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in\n the USB gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to\n the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a\n denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially\n for privilege escalation.\n\n\nFor the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been\nfixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1. This version also fixes some\nrelated bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in\nthe macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug #952660).\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of linux please refer to its\nsecurity tracker page at:\n[\\\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux)\n\n\n",

              "details": "\nIt was discovered that there were two issues in the 1.0 branch of the\nOpenSSL cryptographic system:\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-23840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23840)\nCalls to EVP\\_CipherUpdate, EVP\\_EncryptUpdate and EVP\\_DecryptUpdate may\n overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is\n close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In\n such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating\n success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause\n applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and\n below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to\n OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this\n issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving\n public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade\n to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j\n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected\n 1.0.2-1.0.2x).\n* [CVE-2021-23841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23841)\nThe OpenSSL public API function X509\\_issuer\\_and\\_serial\\_hash() attempts\n to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data\n contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle\n any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur\n if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently\n result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential\n denial of service attack.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.0.2u-1~deb9u4. For the equivalent changes for the 1.1 branch, please see\nDLA-2563-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl1.0 packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: \u003chttps://wiki.debian.org/LTS\u003e\n\n\n",

In\n such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating\n success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause\n applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and\n below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to\n OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this\n issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving\n public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade\n to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j\n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected\n 1.0.2-1.0.2x).\n* [CVE-2021-23841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23841)\nThe OpenSSL public API function X509\\_issuer\\_and\\_serial\\_hash() attempts\n to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data\n contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle\n any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur\n if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently\n result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential\n denial of service attack.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.0l-1~deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: \u003chttps://wiki.debian.org/LTS\u003e\n\n\n",
