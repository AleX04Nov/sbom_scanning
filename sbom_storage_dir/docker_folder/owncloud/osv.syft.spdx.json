By sending malformed requests, the\n http/2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server\n thread cleaning up incoming data, resulting in denial of service.\n* [CVE-2018-17199](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-17199)\nDiego Angulo from ImExHS discovered that mod\\_session\\_cookie does not\n respect expiry time.\n* [CVE-2019-0196](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0196)\nCraig Young discovered that the http/2 request handling in mod\\_http2\n could be made to access freed memory in string comparison when\n determining the method of a request and thus process the request\n incorrectly.\n* [CVE-2019-0211](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0211)\nCharles Fol discovered a privilege escalation from the\n less-privileged child process to the parent process running as root.\n* [CVE-2019-0217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0217)\nA race condition in mod\\_auth\\_digest when running in a threaded\n server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate\n using another username, bypassing configured access control\n restrictions. The issue was discovered by Simon Kappel.\n* [CVE-2019-0220](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-0220)\nBernhard Lorenz of Alpha Strike Labs GmbH reported that URL\n normalizations were inconsistently handled. When the path component\n of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'),\n directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for\n duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers\n processing will implicitly collapse them.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.4.25-3+deb9u7.\n\n\nThis update also contains bug fixes that were scheduled for inclusion in the\nnext stable point release. This includes a fix for a regression caused by a\nsecurity fix in version 2.4.25-3+deb9u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of apache2 please refer to its security\ntracker page at: \u003chttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2\u003e\n\n\n",

              "details": "\nMax Justicz discovered a vulnerability in APT, the high level package manager.\nThe code handling HTTP redirects in the HTTP transport method doesn't properly\nsanitize fields transmitted over the wire. This vulnerability could be used by\nan attacker located as a man-in-the-middle between APT and a mirror to inject\nmalicous content in the HTTP connection. This content could then be recognized\nas a valid package by APT and used later for code execution with root\nprivileges on the target machine.\n\n\nSince the vulnerability is present in the package manager itself, it is\nrecommended to disable redirects in order to prevent exploitation during this\nupgrade only, using:\n\n\n`apt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false update  \n\napt -o Acquire::http::AllowRedirect=false upgrade`\nThis is known to break some proxies when used against security.debian.org. If\nthat happens, people can switch their security APT source to use:\n\n\n`deb \u003chttp://cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org/debian-security\u003e stable/updates main`\nFor the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.9.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.\n\n\nSpecific upgrade instructions:\n\n\nIf upgrading using APT without redirect is not possible in your situation, you\ncan manually download the files (using wget/curl) for your architecture using\nthe URL provided below, verifying that the hashes match. Then you can install\nthem using dpkg -i.\n\n\nSource archives:\n\n\n\u003chttp://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/a/apt/apt_1.4.9.dsc\u003e\n Size/SHA256 checksum: 2549

              "details": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in curl, a command line tool for\ntransferring data with URL syntax and an easy-to-use client-side URL\ntransfer library.\n\n\n* [CVE-2020-8284](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8284)\nWhen curl performs a passive FTP transfer, it first tries the EPSV\n command and if that is not supported, it falls back to using PASV.\n Passive mode is what curl uses by default. A server response to a\n PASV command includes the (IPv4) address and port number for the\n client to connect back to in order to perform the actual data\n transfer. This is how the FTP protocol is designed to work. A\n malicious server can use the PASV response to trick curl into\n connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way\n potentially make curl extract information about services that are\n otherwise private and not disclosed, for example doing port scanning\n and service banner extractions.\n\n\nThe IP address part of the response is now ignored by default, by\n making CURLOPT\\_FTP\\_SKIP\\_PASV\\_IP default to 1L instead of previously\n being 0L. This has the minor drawback that a small fraction of use\n cases might break, when a server truly needs the client to connect\n back to a different IP address than what the control connection uses\n and for those CURLOPT\\_FTP\\_SKIP\\_PASV\\_IP can be set to 0L. The same\n goes for the command line tool, which then might need\n --no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip set to prevent curl from ignoring the address\n in the server response.\n* [CVE-2020-8285](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8285)\nlibcurl offers a wildcard matching functionality, which allows a\n callback (set with CURLOPT\\_CHUNK\\_BGN\\_FUNCTION) to return information\n back to libcurl on how to handle a specific entry in a directory\n when libcurl iterates over a list of all available entries. When\n this callback returns CURL\\_CHUNK\\_BGN\\_FUNC\\_SKIP, to tell libcurl to\n not deal with that file, the internal function in libcurl then calls\n itself recursively to handle the next directory entry. If there's a\n sufficient amount of file entries and if the callback returns skip\n enough number of times, libcurl runs out of stack space. The exact\n amount will of course vary with platforms, compilers and other\n environmental factors. The content of the remote directory is not\n kept on the stack, so it seems hard for the attacker to control\n exactly what data that overwrites the stack - however it remains a\n Denial-Of-Service vector as a malicious user who controls a server\n that a libcurl-using application works with under these premises can\n trigger a crash.\n\n\nThe internal function is rewritten to instead and more appropriately\n use an ordinary loop instead of the recursive approach. This way,\n the stack use will remain the same no matter how many files that are\n skipped.\n* [CVE-2020-8286](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8286)\nlibcurl offers OCSP stapling via the CURLOPT\\_SSL\\_VERIFYSTATUS\n option. When set, libcurl verifies the OCSP response that a server\n responds with as part of the TLS handshake. It then aborts the TLS\n negotiation if something is wrong with the response. The same\n feature can be enabled with --cert-status using the curl tool. As\n part of the OCSP response verification, a client should verify that\n the response is indeed set out for the correct certificate. This\n step was not performed by libcurl when built or told to use OpenSSL\n as TLS backend. This flaw would allow an attacker, who perhaps\n could have breached a TLS server, to provide a fraudulent OCSP\n response that would appear fine, instead of the real one. Like if\n the original certificate actually has been revoked.\n\n\nThe OCSP response checker function now also verifies that the\n certificate id is the correct one.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n7.52.1-5+deb9u13.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of curl please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n\u003chttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl\u003e\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: \u003chttps://wiki.debian.org/LTS\u003e\n\n\n",

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. When using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_USERPWD` options before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Previously, we would only consider a change in host. Now, we consider any change in host, port or scheme to be a change in origin.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle stream handler backend, rather than curl.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n* [CVE-2022-27776](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "summary": "Cross-domain cookie leakage in Guzzle",
              "details": "### Impact\n\nPrevious version of Guzzle contain a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the `Set-Cookie` header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. For example an attacker at `www.example.com` might set a session cookie for `api.example.net`, logging the Guzzle client into their account and retrieving private API requests from the security log of their account.\n\nNote that our cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with `['cookies' =\u003e true]` are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.3 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.6 or 7.4.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you do not need support for cookies, turn off the cookie middleware. It is already off by default, but if you have turned it on and no longer need it, turn it off.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC6265 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.3)\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/). Do not report additional security advisories in that public channel, however - please follow our [vulnerability reporting process](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/security/policy).\n",

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. When using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_USERPWD` options before continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Previously, we would only consider a change in host. Now, we consider any change in host, port or scheme to be a change in origin.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle stream handler backend, rather than curl.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n* [CVE-2022-27776](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "summary": "Cross-domain cookie leakage in Guzzle",
              "details": "### Impact\n\nPrevious version of Guzzle contain a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the `Set-Cookie` header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. For example an attacker at `www.example.com` might set a session cookie for `api.example.net`, logging the Guzzle client into their account and retrieving private API requests from the security log of their account.\n\nNote that our cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with `['cookies' =\u003e true]` are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.3 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.6 or 7.4.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you do not need support for cookies, turn off the cookie middleware. It is already off by default, but if you have turned it on and no longer need it, turn it off.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC6265 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-5.3)\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/).

              "details": "### Impact\n\n`Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host.\n\n### Patches\n\nAffected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.\n\n### References\n\n* [RFC9110 Section 15.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please get in touch with us in `#guzzle` on the [PHP HTTP Slack](https://php-http.slack.com/). Do not report additional security advisories in that public channel, however - please follow our [vulnerability reporting process](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/security/policy).\n",

Under certain specific conditions this could potentially allow a malicious user to execute code remotely.\n\nThe conditions: \n\n- A user is allowed to supply the path or filename of an uploaded file.\n- The supplied path or filename is not checked against unicode chars.\n- The supplied pathname checked against an extension deny-list, not an allow-list.\n- The supplied path or filename contains a unicode whitespace char in the extension.\n- The uploaded file is stored in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed.\n\nGiven these conditions are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system under attack.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe unicode whitespace removal has been replaced with a rejection (exception).\n\nThe library has been patched in:\n- 1.x: https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/commit/f3ad69181b8afed2c9edf7be5a2918144ff4ea32\n- 2.x: https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/commit/a3c694de9f7e844b76f9d1b61296ebf6e8d89d74\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users, upgrade to 2.1.1.\n",

In\n such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating\n success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause\n applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and\n below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to\n OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this\n issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving\n public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade\n to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j\n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected\n 1.0.2-1.0.2x).\n* [CVE-2021-23841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-23841)\nThe OpenSSL public API function X509\\_issuer\\_and\\_serial\\_hash() attempts\n to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data\n contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle\n any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur\n if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently\n result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential\n denial of service attack.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 Stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n1.1.0l-1~deb9u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: \u003chttps://wiki.debian.org/LTS\u003e\n\n\n",

              "details": "PEAR Archive_Tar version 1.4.3 and earlier contains a CWE-502, CWE-915 vulnerability in the Archive_Tar class. There are several file operations with `$v_header['filename']` as parameter (such as file_exists, is_file, is_dir, etc). When extract is called without a specific prefix path, we can trigger unserialization by crafting a tar file with `phar://[path_to_malicious_phar_file]` as path. Object injection can be used to trigger destruct in the loaded PHP classes, e.g. the Archive_Tar class itself. With Archive_Tar object injection, arbitrary file deletion can occur because `@unlink($this-\u003e_temp_tarname)` is called. If another class with useful gadget is loaded, it may possible to cause remote code execution that can result in files being deleted or possibly modified. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.4.4.",
